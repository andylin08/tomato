# RGB Pomodoro Timer

This is a pocket Pomodoro timer that displays time, date, and motivational quotes using RGB LEDs, dual OLED screens, and Cherry MX switches, all powered by an ESP32-C3. It’s designed to be compact, functional, and visually engaging.

I made this project because I wanted a fun and personal way to stay focused during work sessions. I’ve always liked the tactile feel of mechanical keys and the glow of addressable LEDs, and this felt like a good way to bring them together into something useful. (Also I have like a bunch of unused stickers and I figured I could use them to decorate the case.)
